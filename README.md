Implementations of some data structures in Java.

Has some tests but I'm still getting used to testing in this way so they may no be the best of tests.
The tests are also unfinished.

###Currently has:
* Singly linked LinkedList (Done*)
* ArrayList (Done*) 
* Doubly linked LinkedList (Done*)

###Need to have:
* Hashtable
* Trees
* Graphs


*Needs more testing probably
