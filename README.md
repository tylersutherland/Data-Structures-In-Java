Implementations of some data structures in Java.

Has some tests but I'm still getting used to testing in this way so they may no be the best of tests.
The tests are also unfinished.

###Currently has:
* Singly linked LinkedList(Done*)
* ArrayList (Done*)

###Need to have:
* Hashtable
* Doubly linked LinkedList
* Trees
* Graphs


*Needs more testing probably
